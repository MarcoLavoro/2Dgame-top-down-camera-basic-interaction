This was a challenge to create a simple Playable and runnable 2D game concept with top-down camera

The time for this challenge was 4 days (10 was the total time but I could work only 4 due to the other jobs to do)

Buttons:
Arrow or ASDW to move.
E to interact with interactables (Hoe, Mushroom, Cow)
Space or mouseclick to confirm the dialog message.

How to play:

Starting the game the player will wake up from the bed, you have to confirm the dialog to have a smooth transaction.
The player can go to sleep with a smooth and nice transition, the sleeping will increase the day’s counter by one.
On the map, you will have to place a Cow. The player can talk with the Cow by pressing the “E” button.

After a small dialog, the Cow will give the player a quest to find 5 mushrooms.
Nearby the trees will spawn some mushrooms.
The player can pick up the mushrooms using the hoe that he can grab from somewhere on the map.
To add the hoe to the inventory the player will need to press “E” nearby it.
To pick up the mushrooms the player will need to press “E” nearby it with the hoe equipped from the inventory.
You can cycle selection in the menu by the scroll wheel of the mouse, the selected item will become green.
Once the player picks up the mushrooms they will disappear from the map.

Once you harvested 5 mushrooms, the player can go to talk with the Cow again.
The Cow will give you 100 Money.
The mushrooms will be removed from your inventory.
If you harvested more than 5 mushrooms, the remaining part will still be in the inventory.

The player's inventory is always visible at the bottom of the screen
